# Google-Earth-Engine
There are two maps in here. One is called Land Elevation and the other is Night Lights.

# Land Elevation

This code displays land elevation of lowlands and highlands. Get yourself signed up on Google Earth Engine (free) if you haven't already done it. You can run it yourself to have a look.

1. Copy the code from [here](https://github.com/mayojich/Land_Elevation/blob/master/Land_Elevation_code).
2. Paste it into [Google Earth Engine](https://code.earthengine.google.com/).
3. Hit Run.

There you have it! You should be able to see both maps side by side.

# Night Lights

This is a night map of the Korean Penisular reproduced on Google Earth Engine. Areas with stronger lighting have higher energy consumption and concentrated populations like cities, indicating more infrastructure and stable economies. Darker areas may be mountains, sea, or simply under-developed.

This map may look very different in the next few years. It was just last year my ex team was reporting threat intel on the missile crisis and military escalations. But today's meeting of the two Koreas turns the DMZ into a peace zone. This may not sound like much to some peaceful countries or even some South Koreans, but this is history. 

I think China will continue to influence this relationship because they are sole contributors to North Korea's failed economy. Investing in the country will be expensive with little returns. But someone has to start somewhere to light up the map.
